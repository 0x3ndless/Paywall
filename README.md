## Paywall
Paywall is a Web3-native micro-monetization platform that lets creators earn directly from followers by embedding pay-to-unlock content inside social posts on X. Users can instantly access exclusive alpha calls, insights, or tutorials by paying small crypto amounts (USDC/ETH) — no sign-ups, no redirects. Built for traders, educators, and content creators, Paywall turns posts into crypto-powered paywalls using blockchain for payment settlement and Lit Protocol for content encryption. It’s the simplest way to monetize information instantly while keeping engagement inside the platform.
